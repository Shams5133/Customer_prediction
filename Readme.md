**Insurance Sales Prediction**

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a client will subscribe to term insurance based on historical marketing data. The goal is to identify potential customers who are most likely to convert, enabling targeted outreach through telephonic marketing campaigns, thus reducing costs and improving conversion rates.
